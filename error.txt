I have joined the organization on November 3rd as a Chapter Lead. My core expertise includes Angular, Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices. Prior to this, I worked with EY as an Associate Technical Manager, primarily in the e-commerce domain, where I led teams delivering complex payment-related projects. I look forward to collaborating with cross-functional teams and contributing to our technology and delivery excellence.
